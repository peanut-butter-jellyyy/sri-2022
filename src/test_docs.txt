piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

on two-dimensional panel flutter .
  theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are
discussed .  it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation
from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate
raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./
  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by
several authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was
formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix
approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a
plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those
given by the galerkin method .
  an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of
the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented .

experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

  the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer
problem for a flat plate in a
shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .
solutions for the boundary-
layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity
distribution in the boundary
layer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausen
technique .  comparison with
the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also
been made to show the effect of
vorticity .
